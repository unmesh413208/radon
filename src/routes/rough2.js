 // Your route code will look like this
 app.get("/sol2", function (req, res) {
    //logic : sum of n consecutive numbers is [ n * (first + last) / 2  ]..so get sum of all numbers in array. now take sum of n consecutive numbers.. n would be length+1 as 1 number is missing
    let arr= [33, 34, 35, 37, 38]
    let missingNumber

    ///LOGIC WILL GO HERE 

    res.send(  { data: missingNumber  }  );
});
